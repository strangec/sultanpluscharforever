#Maitree Font

Maitree means friendliness.

Maitree is a Serif Latin & Looped Thai typeface that its wide proportion was designed so it can fit on a device with a variety of screen and form factors. It is characterized by its bigger-than-usual Looped terminal and Serifs that balance out the whole structure. Maitree offers a 6 weight family, and its asymmetry curved terminal is well-suited for both formal and casual usage especially for works that require antique and historical manner.

A similarity between some glyphs such as [ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ] [ฎ ฏ] [บ ป] [ข ช] is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion if each glyph is not clear enough.

Informal loopless Thai typefaces have slightly simplified details, as compared to formal one, so this allows designers to extend the font to black weight and more in some cases.

Sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall textures.

Ttfautohint supports Thai hinting process efficiently. It is an easy-to-use tool that is highly recommended. For more information, visit http://www.freetype.org/ttfautohint/

Glyphs files (.glyphs) in the source folder can be opened in Glyphs program for further development.
Font files (.ttf and .otf) in the fonts folder are compatible with Window, MacOS, and Linux system.
