#Maitree Font

The objective of this project is to create an informal Serif Latin & Looped Thai typeface. Maitree is a modern typeface that has a friendly and welcoming form as it was designed to use in an informal context. Besides, its open part of negative space and its overall width make it highly legible and readable on electronic platform. For Thai alphabets, the counter of looped terminal was designed to be wider than usual and share serif from Latin to make this typeface look informal according to the intention. The family consists of 6 weights.
